★ FEMINISTKAFÉ RONJA BOOK CLUB ★

Hej to you all. Our feminist bookclub goes into another round this semester! The first read will be: The Left Hand of Darkness - Ursula K. Le Guin

“A lone human ambassador is sent to the icebound planet of Winter, a world without sexual prejudice, where the inhabitants’ gender is fluid. His goal is to facilitate Winter’s inclusion in a growing intergalactic civilization. But to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own views and those of the strange, intriguing culture he encounters.”

*Trigger Warnings: Death and grief, Confinement, Misogyny, Incest (minor), Suicide (minor)

*We will meet Tuesdays on the 11.2 and the 25.2 to discuss this book. For the first meeting you can read until inclusive Chapter 10. As always: 17.30 o’clock at Smalands with free Fika.

*Everyone is absolutely welcome to join, also if you haven’t read everything or even if you haven’t read anything and  just want to get a sneak peek into how our book club looks like and/or want some feminist company and talk about books ;)
