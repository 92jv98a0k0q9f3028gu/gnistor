## Our project - Mutual Aid and Organizing

Solidaria is an under construction autonomous social center in Stockholm's commercialized, controlled and segregated environment. It started when different autonomous groups gathered in an assembly for building common movement resources. There, our group formed to do the preparatory work, get and set-up a locale.

Our goal is to have a space and resources to practice material and affective mutual aid, for people to self-organize against and beyond their oppression. We believe that mutual aid and autonomy are necessary to expand social revolutionary organizing and organizing is necessary to expand the scope of autonomy and mutual aid.

So we want Solidaria to be a relevant resource to the people most marginalized, a common free space where new initiatives can form.

Currently in Stockholm there is no capacity to squat or buy space, so we are constantly looking into rental spaces. We have recently found a rental, a large space in a neighborhood where comrades already organize.

So now we turn to comrades, local and international, to support us and finance our project! 

We need money for rent and in order to fund activities that will in the future cover our rent.

Our structure - No single group's space
