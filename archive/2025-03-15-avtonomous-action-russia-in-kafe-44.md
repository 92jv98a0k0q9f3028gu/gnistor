On March 15th at 1:00 PM, the INFO 44 Bookstore will be hosting a presentation on the current situation in Russia. We will meet two activists from Avtonomous Action Russia, a media group that disseminates information and provides an anarchist and anti-fascist perspective. We will certainly talk about the war in Ukraine and how it affects everyday life for people in Russia, but also us in the West. We will also hear about what the anarchist and anti-fascist movement looks like in today's Russia and in exile. Event will be held in English.

About AA:

Autonomous Action is an organisation of anarchists and libertarian communists, founded in 2002. Our goal is to create basis for a new culture, based on self-organisation, radical resistance against capitalism, fascism, militarism, sexism, homophobia and any other forms of discrimination. We are currently working to restore the libertarian and anarchist movement in Russia, after a period of stagnation and repressions.

Never before our focus was in media work, instead we were joining protest movements and organising them. However, unprecendented repression has made it very difficult to organise protests in Russian streets, especially for known activists. This is why we have decided to focus more on online media work, and we need your support in this new situation.
