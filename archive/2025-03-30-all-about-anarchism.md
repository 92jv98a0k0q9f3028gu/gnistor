All About Anarchism study circle – Session 1: What is anarchism??

Let’s talk anarchism, babes! 🏴💅❤️‍🔥
In this study circle we aim to take part of and discuss different anarchist views and how they relate to our contexts. We will pick themes to dive deeper into based on what the group is interested in.

Our first session, “what is anarchism??”, is dedicated to our understanding of anarchism as an idea and a movement. We want to spend this time discussing our different ideas of, and previous encounters with, anarchism, with the hope of broadening all of our perspectives and finding common interests that we want to focus on.
In preparation for this session we are selecting a number of short texts from different fields of anarchist thought and organizing, with hopes that this will give us several different entry points that can add nuance to our discussions. Do you have a suggestion for a text? Email us at the email listed below!

During this first session we also want to discuss the study circle format, and how we can collectively structure our meetings in order to mitigate hierarchies and create a welcoming and accessible learning environment for all of us. We all not only have different relationships to the topics we are centering, but also different needs, wishes and experiences with reading as a learning method. This is a good thing!

Let’s learn together! It's fun! There will be fika! ✨
