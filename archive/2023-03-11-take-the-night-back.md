Calling all the punks, feminists and socialists! ðŸ“¢

Get ready to make some noise in the bougie streets of Lund as we take a stand against the capitalist patriarchy and reclaim our collective power. Join us in a march that is filled with love and revolution, music and chants, and comradery that will shake the foundations of patriarchy and capitalism.

We will chant, we will sing, we will make noise, and we will demand an end to the capitalist patriarchy. We will reclaim the streets and create a space where we can connect with like-minded individuals, build solidarity, and create a better world.

The March starts at 8 in front of smÃ¥lands nation.

Please note that this demo is separatist for trans/non-binary people and/or women.
