We need more climate conversations that lead to action! In this practical workshop we try out different dialogue techniques that we can use when we meet different kinds of problematic climate discourses, such as indifference, hopelessness, power domination techniques, greenwashing or consumer power. 

Through techniques we can change the dynamic of conversations, get away from debate and gain skills on how to i.e form an existential, visionary, feeling-oriented or engaging climate conversation.
