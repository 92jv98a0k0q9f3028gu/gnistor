## For whom?

Artists, designers, architects, musicians, writers, dancers, performers, illustrators, photographers, animators, craftspeople, curators, museum guides and all other kinds of cultural, arts or creative workers. Employed, self-employed or freelance. Sign up below so that we know you are coming!

## What will we be doing?

The theme for this meetup is sharing and learning. Some of us have little to no experience of political/community organizing, but still have ideas to share and are eager to learn from others. Those of us who do have experiences from organizations, campaigns, direct action, petitioning, etc. have valuable insights to share about previous successes and failures. This time we'll be discussing in smaller groups, with a regroup towards the end. We'll also talk about relevant and approachable texts on the subject of  art and organizing that we can read and discuss at our next meetup in October. 

## Who are we?
These meetups are organized by a small group of cultural workers who want to create opportunities for leftist colleagues in the culture, arts and creative fields of Malmö to get together in solidarity and organizing.
