On the 10th of October Historian Quinn Slobodian, who currently holds a professorship at Wellesley College in the US, will hold an open talk on his book Crack-Up Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy. The talk will be held at Lund University in LUX C126 (lecture hall) at 15.15. Slobodian is, probably, currently best known for his authorship of the awarded book Globalists: The End of Empire and the Birth of Neoliberalism, but also for his role as a columnist in, for example, The Guardian.

Crack-Up Capitalism follows the most notorious radical libertarians—from Milton Friedman to Peter Thiel—around the globe as they search for the perfect space for capitalism. Quinn Slobodian leads us from Hong Kong in the 1970s to South Africa in the late days of apartheid, from the neo-Confederate South to the former frontier of the American West, from the medieval City of London to the gold vaults of right-wing billionaires, and finally into the world’s oceans and war zones, charting the relentless quest for a blank slate where market competition is unfettered by democracy.

The talk is a collaborative event arranged by Konflikt & Motstånd at the Department of History, and the Department of Human Geography.
