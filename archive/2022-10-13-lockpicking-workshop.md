Nattsvart Verkstad is open for random drop-ins, people hanging out, cooking, listening to music, showering or whatever is needed in the community. If the door is closed, ring the doorbell to get let in. 

This Thursday we will also host a lockpicking workshop! Learn the basics, understand locks and their mechanism, and try it out!
