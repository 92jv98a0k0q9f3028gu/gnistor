After 11 months of a genocidal campaign on Palestinians in the Gaza strip and over 75 years of occupation, apartheid and settler colonialism in Palestine, it's more pressing than ever to stand with Palestine, with the means each and everyone of us has. For game developers and designers in the Gothenburg area in Sweden, it's obvious:

## GAME JAM FOR PALESTINE GOTHENBURG 2024

The theme of this game jam is to freely interpret its title, "Game Jam for Palestine". Feel free to use this game jam to explore and express your own relationship to Palestine, its occupation and struggle for liberation and its international solidarity movement in Gothenburg and beyond. 

You could create an educational retelling about one or more historical events, an intimate reflection on personal experiences carried by you and people you know, or an interactive guide and call to collective action and organizing.

It is also always an option to freely create a game with its own themes or topics, and taking this game jam as simply an opportunity to come together with others in solidarity with Gaza and all of Palestine.
