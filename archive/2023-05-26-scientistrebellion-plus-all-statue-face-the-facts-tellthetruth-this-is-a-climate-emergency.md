Location Nybroplan (Raoul Wallenbergs Torg), Stockholm John Ericsson Statue

We are now 100 groups around the world creating Silent Statues representing the silence of our leaders, politicians, media, business leaders about the UN IPCC report. 

The plan is to blindfold the statue add a sign and take a picture.
The blindfolds and signs are often left for days or longer.
All climate Groups are welcome.
Duration 10-30 minutes.
