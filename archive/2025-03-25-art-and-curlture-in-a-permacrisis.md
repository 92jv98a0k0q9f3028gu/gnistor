We’re back! 

Short notice this time but we’ll make sure to book some subsequent dates when we meet this time!

WHAT IS THIS/WHY DID I GET THIS EMAIL?: Kulturarbetare före er! / Culutral Workers Unite! Is a loose group of cultural workers who organize meetups to create opportunities for leftist colleagues in the culture, arts and creative fields of Malmö to get together in solidarity and organizing. We can be found here: INSTAGRAM, WEBSITE and gather some inspiration/resources HERE. 

Where: KKVMM, Bragegatan 15, Malmö
When: Tuesday March 25th, 17.30-19.30
What: ART IN A PERMACRISIS: WTF DO WE DO?
We’ve been ”living in unprecedented times” long enough to know that the world is in a state of crisis, and has been for a while. The various crises we face here in Sweden and around the globe today don’t happen in isolation in a violent, extractive, capitalist system—they ignite, fuel, and worsen each other by design. 

We want to make some time and space to look at what our role as artists and creatives is in a permacrisis. How do we respond? What power do we have? What and who does and can our art serve?

Join us as we meet and discuss this to move towards a manifesto for Cultural Workers Unite! The usual ranting and venting is, of course, always welcome.
