Tales of anarchy and its practice, part 3 - Contemporary anarchist thoughts
Short url: https://squ.at/r/8v9c

In september and october 2022, in Stockholm, we will host a short introductory course on how revolutionary anarchism functions as praxis. The intended audience is anyone who is, or wants to be, serious about political projects within the anarchist movement. 

This is the third and final session "Black anarchism, concepts of power, queer and critical theory".
The content will be addressed both in lecture format and in seminar forms.

	13.00 - 15.00. Session A: Decolonized anarchism, Black Anarchism & the Black Panthers
	15.00 - 16.00. Dinner break
	16.00 - 18.00. Session B: Critical theory and queer theory from an anarchist perspective

As a participant, you are expected to have attended the two previous sessions since they build on each other. Of course, we also understand that that is sometimes impossible and you are welcome to join in on just one if that is what your schedule allows you.

Learning outcomes:

Upon completing the course you will have a better grasp on what constitutes revolutionary anarchism and have better tools for creating and coordinating within that framework. You will also have an understanding of anarchism as a broad movement and the implications of the struggles that lie ahead of us.
