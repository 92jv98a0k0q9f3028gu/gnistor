Reclaim The Change is this years anti-capitalist climate-camp in Denmark, focusing on wealth inequality and green colonialism. It would be great to see some of our comrades from the other side of the bridge there, so we are coming to Lund to hold an info meeting.

We imagine the camp to be a space of care and co-creation where we sleep in tents, cook food together, share visions of a just future over bonfires and enable affinity group actions.

* Where India Däck, Lund
* When 18th of May, 1800

## We are unstoppable - another world is possible.
