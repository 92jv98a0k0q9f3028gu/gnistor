Film screening! Fairytales of Growth - Intro in to Degrowth

🐌 Join us for the first event in our new series: Get to Know Degrowth!

🎥 For the first event, we will be screening the film FAIRYTALES OF GROWTH which introduces degrowth and many of its central ideas.

🎤 We will have a discussion with the film director Pierre Smith Khanna, in conversation with Cecilia Paulsson (director of Outgrow the System).

🍄 This event is perfect for people wanting to know more about degrowth and alternatives to the capitalist system. No previous knowledge of degrowth is required!
