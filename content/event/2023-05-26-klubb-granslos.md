IMÄI and Klubb Gränslös are always anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-transphobia, anti-homophobia, anti-ableist, no borders movements. We have a zero tolerance towards discrimination and violence. There will be activists immediately visible with easy-to-spot clothes inside and outside the space to make sure guests know where to seek help if emergency or harassment occur. We will also offer service to be accompanied to the metro.

## Accessibility

The walkway outside Cyklopen is made of asphalt, however there is gravel around the immediate surrounding of the house. Inside the house there is an elevator that take you to all floors. The elevator is steared by the pressing a button during the full journey. There are no doorsteps in the building and two toilets and one of them is spacious. Any other access needs, or questions around accessibility, please contact us at stockholm@ingenillegal.org and we will do everything we can to welcome you better.

Details for how to get to Cyklopen can be found here. https://cyklopen.se/hitta-till-oss/

The event is hosted by Ingen Människa är Illegal: a network that doesn’t accept national borders and work to support undocumented people in Stockholm. The money will go immediately to those in the network that need economic support./
