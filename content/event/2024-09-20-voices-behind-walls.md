Comrades,

It would seem that we are living through hard times, and they are only getting harder.  It looks like our movmements, friends, comrades,organizations, protests, neighbors, activities are ending up on the wrong side of law enforcement regardless of legality or illegality.

Some of us will be kidnapped and held by the state, punished for the crime of seeking justice or even basic survival.  We can neither meet this with despair nor let the state take away our people so easily.  We need to keep our comrades active in our communities.  

As a first project of Nattsvart's new antirepression working group we will hold an art show and education weekend featuring the art, literature, music, and words of imprisoned comrades. Stay tuned in for more updates about this event!

If you have suggestions for speakers, activities, or contributors please let us know as soon as possible.  Let's keep our friends connected in spite of the states cruel fucking bullshit!
