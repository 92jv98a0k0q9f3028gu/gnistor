## Four Thieves Vinegar will guest us

Four Thieves Vinegar Collective will talk about access to different medical technologies, biohacking access, and how the medical industrial complex complicates that. They talk about the importance of being able to build medical infrastructure in your own communities. Their old projects include the DIY Epi Pencil. Their new projects include new ways to access medicines for abortion, regimens forpairing emergency contraception with PReP, and potential medicines for the treatment of Long Covid.

Welcome!
