Workshop: Grassroot approaches to urban surveillance through software design & development.

In this workshop we will present a research project that tries to identify what is going on in the Nordics (SWE, DEN, FIN), with the digitalization of police forces in general and urban surveillance in particular. 

We want to examine potential ways of bottom-up resistance to the “Camera Offensive”, the new surveillance shift which takes place in Sweden and has a substantial influence in neighboring countries.

The conversation will revolve around the description of this territory of surveillance and its exposure. What are the old and new systems deployed by the police? Who do these systems target exactly? Can these systems be circumvented? Can we think of possible software to help bypass or disclose this network? Is an algorithm for determining police violence or the next police raid feasible? Is a probabilistic mapping scenario of the expansion of the police surveillance network beneficial for targeted political interventions?

Having these questions in mind, we want to explore ways of counter-engineering software systems and try to see how such systems can be used for emancipatory purposes.
