Fundraiser for students and activists who have been charged for their solidarity with Palestine.

During the spring of 2024, encampments were set up at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and Stockholm University (SU) to pressure the universities to end their institutional collaborations with Israeli universities, institutions, and companies. At the 'Gaza Solidarity Encampment' and ‘Fria Palestinas Plats,’ students, teachers, staff, activists, and supporters gathered to break the silence echoing from the universities, through peaceful protests and actions.

As a result, Stockholm's two encampments are organizing a fundraiser to support the students and activists facing financial repercussions due to their activism for a free Palestine and a Sweden that does not enable genocide.

On September 7th, we will gather at Cyklopen from 18-02 for an evening of food, drinks, talks, poetry, music and dance.
