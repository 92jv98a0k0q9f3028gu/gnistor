The anarchist book circle at Solidaria will have its next meeting at 18:00 on March 26, when we will be discussing The Nation on No Map: Black Anarchism and Abolition, by William C. Anderson. Andersons book is a powerful argument for anarchism from the perspective of the struggle for Black liberation. Anderson offers Black anarchism as a framework for fighting the state, white supremacy, nationalism and capitalism.

If you want to join, just read the book (or as much as you have time to read) and come to the meeting to to discuss it! The book is available for free online. Looking forward to see you there!
