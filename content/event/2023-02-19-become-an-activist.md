Civil Disobedience has been part of almost every major societal change throughout history, and the present is no exception. From the women of Iran taking off their hijabs, to climate activists in front of oil refineries, to indigenous people standing between machine and nature, we find Civil Disobedience in social struggles around the globe.

**Why? Because it works.**

Many of us feel hopelessness and powerlessness when we think about where the world is going. The only antidote to these feelings is to get active. So join us and take action with Greenpeace! Come to our introduction to civil disobedience. (Registration form can be found further down)

On October 22nd, we will open up our one-day training to the public. This is the introduction which all our volunteers and staff undergo when they join Greenpeace. During the training we will go through Greenpeace's core values and how we work. We will talk about the history of Civil Disobedience, the principles on which it rests and how we apply Civil Disobedience in our work for a more peaceful and greener world.

* **When** Sunday 19th February 
* **Time** 8 AM – 4 PM CEST (9 AM - 5 PM EEST)
* **Where** Online!

SIGN UP to the training through this form: https://forms.gle/CTqrpscGZQq1fWei9

This is a Nordic training and therefore all content and conversations are held in ENGLISH.

This training is the first step to becoming a volunteer with us. If, if after this introduction you are inspired and you also want to participate in acts of civil disobedience with Greenpeaceactions (you are needed!) there is a further in-depth training offered at a later date.

We have the power to change when we organise TOGETHER, so we need YOU.

Please tell your friends, parents and anyone you think might be interested about this training!
