In september and october 2022, in Stockholm, we will host a short introductory course on how revolutionary anarchism functions as praxis. The intended audience is anyone who is, or wants to be, serious about political projects within the anarchist movement.

This is the first of three parts, "Socialism without the state, a historical introduction".
The content will be addressed both in lecture format and in seminar forms.'

- 13.00 - 15.00. Session A: Paris commune, the first international and May 1st
- 15.00 - 16.00. Dinner break
- 16.00 - 18.00. Session B: Spain and the early 20th century

As a participant, you are expected to attend all three of the sessions since they build on each other. Of course, we also understand that that is sometimes impossible and you are welcome to join in on just one if that is what your schedule allows you.

## Learning outcomes:

Upon completing the course you will have a better grasp on what constitutes revolutionary anarchism and have better tools for creating and coordinating within that framework. You will also have an understanding of anarchism as a broad movement and the implications of the struggles that lie ahead of us.
