Discussion with questions and answers session with activists from Anti-authoritarian volunteer network from Ukraine

Solidarity Collectives is a group of Ukrainian ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ anarchists who support their comrades fighting at the front and help those affected by the Russian invasion.

Based on anti-authoritarian ideas, they actively resist imperialist aggression. With the values of proactive feminism in mind, many women activists from Solidarity collectives are at the forefront of resisting the aggressor, actively contributing to military initiatives. Collectives support global anti-authoritarian and anti-colonial movements and advocate for animal rights, supplying vegan food to fighters and pushing for renewable energy to reduce fuel dependency.

An activist from the Solidarity Collective and ABC Kyiv (in person) and a fighter from Ukraine (online, if time and circumstances allow) will speak about their struggle against colonial imperialist policies, their previous work in support of Russian and Belarusian refugees, their current work and the way the collectives are functioning during the full-scale invasion.

There will also be the chance to buy merchandise and make donations to support anti-authoritarian fighters in Ukraine.

The event will be held in English.
