Feminist café Ronja presents Discussion of the SCUM manifesto!

Its going to be a night filled with interesting discussions of the greatest manifesto of all time (apart for the communist manifesto)!

The SCUM manifesto is written by Valerie Solanas and is a short book that turns the patriarchy on its head. Its an amazing critique of society that everyone should read at least once. 

Read the manifesto again or if its your first time read the pdf below and come prepared for a night of manhating! 
Are men just walking dildos or what did Valerie Solanas say in the manifesto?
