We invite you to a cozy night of conversation and community with author Mx. Yaffa, a queer Indigenous Palestinian. We’ll be diving into their latest book ‘Whispers Beneath the Orange Grove,’ where Yaffa blends personal narratives with strategies to build a liberated world grounded in mutual aid, community care, and collectivism.

Rooted in Indigenous Palestinian culture and guided by love, spirituality, and belonging, this space will offer a compelling vision of resistance and practical tools for organisers and mobilisers —both new and experienced—dedicated to creating a just world.

Whispers Beneath the Orange Grove is an essay collection where Yaffa blends personal narratives with strategies to build a liberated world grounded in mutual aid, community care, and collectivism. Rooted in Indigenous Palestinian culture and guided by love, spirituality, and belonging, Yaffa offers a compelling vision and practical tools for organizers and mobilizers—both new and experienced—dedicated to creating a just world.

Reflecting on experiences like being unhoused and navigating psychosis, Yaffa emphasizes survival and resistance strategies. Drawing on lessons from post-9/11, the collection addresses the current rise of fascism and presents tools like community care as a practice to strengthen collective bonds. Critically engaging with settler colonialism, the essays focus on the most marginalized, offering a roadmap for collective liberation and a more just future.
