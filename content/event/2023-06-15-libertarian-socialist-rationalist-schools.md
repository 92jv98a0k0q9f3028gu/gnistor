This talk will try to place the anarcho-syndicalist rationalist schools practices in the context of the radical urban labor culture in Spain and the transnational network of intellectuals and schools of the time. This exemplified by sources about schools such as the Escuela Moderne Valencia(1907-1927), Escuela Natura in Barcelona(1917-1936), the schools of the CENU(1936), an educational reform in Catalonia sperhaded by Joan Puig Eliass (1898-1972) and other CNT aktivist, and som eks. of refugee schools and colonies for children organized by the CNT(1936-1939).

This talk highlights the pedagogical practical and ideological dilemmas this school presentet at the time and how these dilemmas are still relevant today.

This talk Is part of an larger attempt to map anarchist/libertarian pedagogy that began with a bachelors thesis in Danish on “Anarkistiske Pædagogik - Fri sind og rationalitet” back in Jan. 2012. The lecture will be held in English as much as possible, but Danish will be spoken.

The presenter works daily in a kindergarten, is an activist for Den Kritisk Pædagogiske Højskole and at Bogcaféen Halmtorvet in Cph.
