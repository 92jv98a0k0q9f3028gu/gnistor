The revolutionary’s tools – Graphic design 2 of 2

Images are not only constantly present in our surroundings, they are also a powerful way to convey ideas and messages. Graphical design is therefore an important skill to learn if you want to get politically involved and want to let others know about what you think or you plan to do. While it is an art that is hard to master, it is possible to learn the basics of how to design your own posters, stickers or social media banners relatively quickly - which is why we arrange two workshops* on the topic as part of our series on the Revolutionarys tools.

In the second workshop we will receive an introduction into communication strategy. We will then move on to talk about some of the practicalities of graphic design such as color techniques, typography and how to pick a good image or illustration suiting the purpose of your design. This knowledge will then be put into practice when you design your own poster (on your own computer or with arts and crafts).

The workshop will be held by Sesil, you can find her work at @barrikadegrafik. The language will be english, and the workshop will approximately take 5 hours including a lunch break. Syndikalistiskt Forum will provide lunch for a small price.

This workshop is part of our event series ”The revolutionary’s tools”

* The details of the first workshop are still unclear, but will be published as soon as possible. It is about how to use graphic design tools on the computer, and we plan to have it before the second workshop.
