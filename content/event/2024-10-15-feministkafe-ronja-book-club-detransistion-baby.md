FEMINISTKAFÉ RONJA BOOK CLUB: DETRANSISTION, BABY 
★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★

The next coming months we are going to read different feminist books, starting with: Detransition, Baby. The debut novel of Torrey Peters has been met with good reviews and has been nominated for the 2021 Women’s Prize for Fiction. The book has three main characters who live in New York and are in complicated relationships with each other. While one of them is detransitioning and the other gets pregnant with him, they try to think about new ways to make this unconventional family work. 
A book about gender, parenthood, relationships, and trans life. 
Do you want to read this with us and join our feminist book club? You can! 

For the first meeting on the 1st of October, we are going to read the first three chapters (around a 110 pages). We will have some discussion points and just chat about what we have read. It's completely fine if you haven't read everything or can't come to every meeting!!  Everyone is welcome, we just love to talk about books:) 
The second and the third parts of the book will be discussed on the 15th and 29th of October, same time, same place.
